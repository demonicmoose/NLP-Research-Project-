https://dumps.wikimedia.org/hiwiki/20191020/hiwiki-20191020-pages-articles-multistream.xml.bz2 

This is a 1GB XML file of all hindi wikipedia articles. (Hard to open a 1GB file)

The xml file has various tags for every article - refer tags.png

<text> tag contains the article

Referred https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract for extracing data from Wiktionary

Converted the unicode characters \u... into human readable form but found that the file generated only contains redirect data. - refer wiktwords.txt and test.php

Then wrote a php file to parse the wiki dump and find all <text> tags and append them into a file to create the dictionary.
