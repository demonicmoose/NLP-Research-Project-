# NLP-Research-Project-

Developed a Lemmatizer for Hindi Language which generates a proper meaningful root word.

Dataset used: Hindi Dependency Treebank (HDTB) -> UD_Hindi-HDTB

Final files are under Final Implementation Folder

Flow of the code:

wordtag_train.txt - Train Data for the POS Tagger

test.txt - Text Input to POS Tagger

supervised.py - POS Tagger code

output_test.txt - Output generated by POS Tagger

wordtag_test.txt - Already Tagged Test data (Used for checking the accuracy)

lemmatizer.py - Lemmatizer code

processModel.py â€“ For creating rules.txt and rules2.txt 

rules2.txt - rules extracted from the HDTB data (word tag previous_tag lemma)

output_test.txt - Output of POS Tagger (Used in Lemmatizer as taggedFile)

testlemma.txt - Already Lemmatized Test data
testOutput.txt - Output generated by Lemmatizer
accuracy.py - accuracy calculation code
